			our recent accomplishments, and explain what your sponsorship will mean to us.</p>
		<p>In the pages that follow, we hope to share our passion for cycling and explain the value of partnering

		<h1 class="header">OUR MISSION</h1>
		<p>As an entirely student run organization, Case Cycling is built on the passion and dedication of its members. Our goal is to send
			riders to 20 races across three disciplines this year. Without your support this is not possible. For the 2014 season, our target
			is to raise $10,000 to subsidize travel, lodging, entry fees, and equipment for collegiate races. With your help, we can secure the
			future of cycling at Case Western Reserve University.</p>

		<h1 class="header">GIVING BACK</h1>
		<p>In addition to leading rides from our campus, we assist the community in charitable causes and local events.</p>
		<p>Members of Case Cycling worked in conjunction with Bike Cleveland to run a bike safety check, ensuring that community bikes were safe
			for National Bike to Work Day.</p>
		<p>Between an on-call Fix My Bike service and a biannual bike tune-up event for University Circle residents, club members repaired over 100
			bikes and instructed attendees on basic principles for proper bicycling maintenance.</p>
		<p>This season, we plan to co-host the NEOCX Season Finale on December 14 with Fast Track Cycling. We are also working towards hosting our first
			collegiate track race in the fall, and a collegiate road race in the spring. These events will provide our team with valuable racing and
			leadership experience, and offer additional sponsorship opportunities.</p>

		<b class="sub_header">NEW ADDITIONS: TRACK AND CYCLOCROSS</b>
		<p>2012 marked Case Cyclingâ€™s first foray into the disciplines of cyclocross and track. Despite this being foreign territory for most of our racers, Case won the Division II title at the MWCCCTrack Regionals in Indianapolis, IN and competed at Collegiate Cyclocross Nationals in Madison, WI. With cyclocross booming throughout the Midwest, we see this discipline as a key area of growth. In the years to come, we hope to expand participation and continue to excel at races, building on our strengths and creating a national-caliber cycling program. </p>
		<br>
		<b class="sub_header">GOALS</b>
		<p>In the world of collegiate cycling, few schools have top-ranked academics and nationally-recognized athletics; we plan to excel in both. Last year, Case's cycling program saw immense growth and development, becoming the number-one-ranked collegiate team in Ohio and achieved its first ever national ranking in the team's 14 year history. As the program continues to expand, our goal is to recruit students with a passion for both academic endeavors and cycling.</p>
